Project Overview

This project showcases a comprehensive data analysis and visualization pipeline built using SQL Server and Power BI, leveraging data from the AdventureWorks dataset. 
The goal was to clean, transform, and model the data for creating interactive dashboards that provide insights into sales performance and customer details.

Project Details

Data Preparation:

- Used SQL Server to extract only the relevant columns from the FactInternetSales, DimProduct, and DimCustomer tables.
  Performed initial data cleaning and filtering operations in SQL to optimize the dataset for analysis.
  Data Transformation:

- Imported the cleaned data into Power BI and performed further cleaning using Power Query.
  Created a custom DimDate table using DAX to enable time-based analysis.
  Data Modeling:

- Established relationships between the fact and dimension tables in a star schema format.
  Ensured optimized model performance for better visualization interactivity.
  Visualizations:

Designed two interactive dashboards:

Sales Overview Dashboard: Highlights overall sales performance with KPIs, trends, and product performance.

Customer Details Dashboard: Provides detailed insights into customer demographics and purchasing patterns.

Tools and Technologies
